# Entry 6
##### 6/1/2022

So we have done it. We are at the end of our journey in coding my ASL project. This was a really wild nevertheless. I have gain alot of valuable experiences throughout the journey. And needless to say, my peers and my instructor Mr.Mueller has played a huge part in my growth. In this last blog, I will be talking about my experience presenting.

#### Elevator Pitch

Performing an elevator pitch not only allowed me to practice my public skills, it also allowed me to gain confedience about my own project while reflecitng upon the main points of my coding project. I also realized that I am someone who need to cut out things that my audience may have already known to limit overbearing information to my audience and keep them 100% interested in my project.

#### In class presentation

During my class presentation, I started realizing that my presentation skills have been improving over the last couple of years of my high school career. I remember the first time I presented, my voice was shaking and I would be speaking really fast without realizing what I was saying to the public. I also remember my slide shows were really just read base of the slides and the readers would die a slow boredom death. I now understood the presentation skills better.

#### Overview

Although I ended up not finishing my project the way I intended it to be, I still learned about skills such as being flexible, adapting and lastly researching. This time, my learning was not only academic, but it was a life lesson that I will take until I finish my career as a coder mentioned above. The skill I am learning is embracing my failures. Although I am a bit disappointed at myself that my project was not how I wanted it to be, I also want to appreicate my effort in attempt to get to that point where I wanted to be. I am currently in the communicating my result part of the EDP process, I have communicated what I created to many people, and this product is currently a product that I want to continue to develop on to get to my final goal of using machine learning to complete a sign language interface. I am half way there, but I believe that I will reach that goal as long as I perseve through the obstacles.
