After two weeks of reseaching topics and coding languages that I may want to learn and build on, I have decided to dedicate my learning time to Ml5, a machine learning interface based of TensorFlow.js. This language is used for handling GPU-accelerated mathematical operations and memory. I have decided on this tool because my project's focus is using camera to recognize hand signs that the user is performing and matching it to the data set with the correct answer to help them learn sign language step by step.

Some sources that I have considered is (https://ml5js.org/)[ML5 the offical website],(https://medium.com/swlh/number-hand-gestures-recognition-using-tensorflow-js-618ff0e1df2)[A semi tutorial to ml5], and a (https://youtu.be/ZTSRZt04JkY)[Youtube video to start the process].


My current engineering process right now is planning a possible solution that will potentially help the hearing disabled community to adpat to their new lifestyle easier and more efficently. My next step is try to plan the way that I want things to work and how the user and my code will work togther to perform necessary functions.

The skill I am working towards is consideration and getting used to reading documentaries (How to read). Creativity is needed to brainstorm ideas to see what I will do in order to start driving my plane. The next step is attempt to organize what I need to learn to do in each step of Machine learning.
