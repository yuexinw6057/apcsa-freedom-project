### Welcome back!

You have made it to the fourth blog...things are getting a bit more serious now as I get closer to the deadline in April. Previously, there was an error on my code from the ML5.js starter code. The error seems to be unknown as I tried to debug. While trying to debug though however, I was not able to find the error since I added some of my own code into the program without pushing it to github. Which...ended up messing up the debugging process for me more since I do not know if the error was from the original template or if it happened after I added in my lines of code. With the advice of our instructor, Mr.Muller, he adviced me to restart from scratch and see if the code was broken before I added my line of code or afterwards.

...Although that was the first thing I tried, I was still not able to understand the same error that it gave me. Which means that this was an error from the template code. Searching for an alternative `ML5.js` code template was a bit of a challenge since there was not a lot of resources out there. Knowing that `ml5.js` is the simplified version of `Tensorflow.js`, I decided to restart the whole entire process with [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/tutorials/setup) instead.
